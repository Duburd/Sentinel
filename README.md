This is a template for setting up webpack, for use with babel and generally for use with React &c.

It assumes `yarn` rather than npm, though I suspect it doesn't really matter.


## Currently Working

Webpack is currently working, and `yarn dev` will bring up the webpack-dev-server.



## Wishlist


Currently we can production-build with just `yarn run webpack`.
