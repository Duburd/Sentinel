I like webpack.  Let's intall a recent webpack.
  Need to make/find a list of useful loaders and plugins.

Also Babel is good.
  Need to make/find a list of useful presets/whatevers.

I like React.  Does that matter to this?  What about various React libs?  Router?  Redux?

Do I care about any CSS stuff?  Sass?  CSS framework?  At this time I do not.

I might want a linter, and/or a test-runner.  I might want Typescript or Flow.

I want a client and server dir, because many projects require that.  Though not all.
  Either way, I want a webpack dev server setup.  With optional proxy through to the server-server.



Okay, my starting point should be to
  * get webpack working
    * with Babel
      * with a few default presets
    * with webpack-dev-server
  * client directory only; later expand to worry about server (and thus proxy, etc)
  * no prod version for now
