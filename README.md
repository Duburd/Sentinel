### Sentinel

Sentinel is a full stack web app for insurance companies to manage and edit reports submitted by clients.


## Currently Working

Webpack is currently working, and `yarn dev` will bring up the webpack-dev-server.



## Wishlist


Currently we can production-build with just `yarn run webpack`.
